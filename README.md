# view-in-swagger-button
An .svg file for adding Markdown "View in Swagger" buttons to sites and README files

### Button
This is what the button looks like. It's basically the same thing as the [Run in Postman button](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/run_button).

### Usage
Pop this bad boy in your README file and link to your [Swagger UI](http://swagger.io/swagger-ui/) instance. Make sure the location of your `.yml` file is referenced after the URL's `?url=` query.
